# Word_Guess_Game
READ-ME:
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The player will get a clue in the form of an image with a specific suit from popular culture spider-man images

2. the player will have 7 guesses to get the suit name correct.
    2a. the console will log the players guesses for them but the answer will not be shown on the screen.
3. when the player wins/loses the game resets with an alert.


TECH USED:
i used Javascript, CSS, & HTML.

the javascript here is used to create user interaction and give proper methodical responses per the games rules. this will translate later to more complexe loops.

the best way to get started is the form a pathway model and figure the individual sections. 
i started with the javascript rules first as it took the longest. practice, research and more practice it came together.

look up git hub for starters, then look to other sites for references and similar projects. some more complex sites may hold examples for simpler versions of what you need. Ie: the guesses being logged and shown took a minute to understand but i found multiple examples showing how it worked.
